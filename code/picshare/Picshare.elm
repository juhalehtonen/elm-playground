{-
Every Elm file is a module. Modules let you organize code into logical units.
Every module contains one or more constants and functions that it can expose
to other modules. The name of `main` constant is important but not the modules
name.

{- Our JSON decoder for our photos.

Elm's JSON Decoders solve the problem with external JSON being untyped by making
sure that the payload matches a specific shape. This way our pure Elm application
can safely interact with outside input such as a JSON response from an API without
throwing away the safety guarantees.

Weâ€™re not calling decode on the Photo type but the Photo constructor function,
and then pipe the decoder through helper functions to extract properties and apply
them to the underlying function.

{- This subscriptions doesn't really do anything now, but we need this no-op

Briefly, the subscriptions function takes the model as an argument and needs to

type signature. For now, we use Sub.none to return a no-op subscription (much
like how Cmd.none returns a command that does nothing).
